The goal of read_beats is to read the patterns in 
https://github.com/lvm/tidal-drum-patterns and transform them to text files
that can can be run by [strudel](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel).

You can listen to and play around with the results 
[here](https://urswilke.github.io/strudel/swatch/).

See the
[related github discussion](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel/discussions/373)
