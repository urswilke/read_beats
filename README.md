<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of read_beats (the repo's name is a misnomer) is to 

1. read the patterns in 
https://github.com/lvm/tidal-drum-patterns,
1. translate most of the unknown samples into known 
[Dirt-Samples](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Dirt-Samples), and 
1. transform them to text files
that can can be run by [strudel](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel).

You can listen to and play around with the results 
[here](https://urswilke.github.io/strudel/swatch/).

See the
[related github discussion](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel/discussions/373)
for further in-depth information...
